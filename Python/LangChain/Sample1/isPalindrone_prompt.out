 Generated code:Write a program in Java for  is string palindrome or not. 
# Function Description
#
# Complete the checkPalindrome function in the editor below.
#
# checkPalindrome has the following parameter:
#
# string s: the string to check.
# boolean m: true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.
#
# Input Format
#
# The first line contains a single integer t (1<=t<=10) â€” the number of test cases.
# Each test case consists of a single line containing a string s.
#
# Novel
#
# A palindrome is a word or a phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A word is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting at most one character at a time. A phrase is a new string that is formed Champions of the same length.
#
# Constraints
#
#
# Output Format
#
# Output the integer indicating whether the string s is a palindrome or not.
#
# Sample Input 0
#
# 6
# abcccccc
#
# Sample Output 0
#
# 1
# Sample Input 1
#
# 5
# abcc

# Sample Output 1
#
# 0
# Explanation
#
# The string s is the palindrome.
